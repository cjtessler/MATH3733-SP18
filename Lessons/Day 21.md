# Day 21

Object-Oriented Programming 
Crash Course Python (Chapter 9)
We write classes to represent read-world things and situations, and we create objects based on these classes When we write a class, we define the general behavior that a whole category of objects can have.

## Classes

```python
### Example: Turtle ###
# import the Turtle class from the turtle module
from turtle import Turtle

# instantiate a turtle object from the class
Bob = Turtle()
Bob.color('blue')
Bob.shape("turtle")
Bob.forward(100)

# instantiate a second turtle object from the class
Katie = Turtle()
Katie.color('red')
Katie.left(180)
```

## dog.py

```python
### Creating and Using a Class
# dog.py
class Dog():	# convention: names of classes are capitalized
   	"""A simple attempt to model a dog."""
    
    def __init__(self, name, age):	# runs whenever an object is instantiated
        """Initialize name and age attributes."""
        # Any variable prefixed with self is available to every method in the class
        self.name = name
        self.age = age		
        
    def sit(self):	# a method is a function that is a part of a class
        """Simulate a dog sitting in response to a command."""
        print(self.name.title() + " is now sitting.")
        
    def roll_over(self):
        """Simulate rolling over in response to a command."""
        print(self.name.title() + " rolled over.")
        
 ### Making an instance from a class
my_dog = Dog('willie', 6)

# we use dot notation to access class attributes and methods
print("My dog's name is " + my_dog.name.title() + ".")
print("My dog is " + str(my_dog.age) + " years old.")
my_dog.sit()
my_dog.roll_over()
```

## restaurant.py v1

```python
# Exercise: restaraunt.py
'''Make a class called  Restaurant . The  __init__() method for Restaurant should store two attributes: a restaurant_name and a cuisine_type. Make a method called describe_restaurant() that prints these two pieces of information, and a method called  open_restaurant() that prints a message indicating that the restaurant is open.
Make an instance called  restaurant from your class . Print the two attributes individually, and then call both methods .'''

class Restaurant():
    """A simple attempt to model a restaurant."""

    def open_restaurant(self):

        print(f"{self.restaurant_name.title()} is open!")

print(pizza_place.restaurant_type)

### Working with Classes and Instances

        """Return a neatly formatted descriptive name."""
        long_name = str(self.year) + ' ' + self.make + ' ' + self.model
        return long_name.title()


my_old_car = Car('chevy', 'lumina', 1994)	# Create instance of the car

# Exercise
'''Start with your program from earlier.
Add an attribute called number_served with a default value of 0. Create an
instance called restaurant from this class. Print the number of customers the
restaurant has served, and then change this value and print it again.

Add a method called set_number_served() that lets you set the number
of customers that have been served. Call this method with a new number and
print the value again.

Add a method called increment_number_served() that lets you increment
the number of customers whoâ€™ve been served. Call this method with any num-
ber you like that could represent how many customers were served in, say, a
day of business'''
