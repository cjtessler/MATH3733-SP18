# Final Project

The final project is your opportunity to take your newfound savvy with programming out for a spin and develop your very own piece of software or learn an application of Python and present that. As long as your project draws upon the courseâ€™s lessons, the nature of your project is entirely up to you, albeit subject to approval. 

*It is highly recommend that you install Python locally at this point. Here is a great [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYXdXT2l-Gg) on how to do so. Feel free to bring your computer to me if you need help though!*

## Reading Assignment (Due 4/12)

Use the beginning of these week to research some possible projects. At this point, you have a solid foundation in Python so don't be afraid of loftier ideas. If you are unsure on what you want to do, try the following:

1. Think of a problem you would like to solve.
2. Research a topic that interests you.
2. Review the list of ideas provided below.
3. Come talk to me.

***Write a 250 word (minimum) plan for your project. Include a clear specification of what you plan to build, links to any tutorials you may use, the features you plan to implement, and what you envision for your presentation.* Your project will evolve as you write it, but it is important to have a clear goal before you begin coding.**

### Ideas

Any projects that would require you to install Python 3.6 natively on your computer is specified as local.

## Project Week (4/16 - 4/20)

Expectations:

- The project is to be an independent endeavor. You are welcome to talk to your peers about your project, but each student is expected to complete a unique project.


- Cite *any* sources you use. This includes tutorials, Stack Overflow answers, GitHub repositories, and any other ideas or examples you see and implement into your project.
- Your project should demonstrate mastery of many, if not all, of the programming concepts covered in class: Variables, Functions, Conditionals, Iteration, Strings, Lists, Dictionaries, Classes, Reading Data, etc.
- Demonstrate mastery by explaining your project during presentation week.
- Put in the time necessary outside of class to complete a polished project.


## Presentations Week (4/26 and 4/28)

The presentation is to be 10-12 minutes. 

No interactivity is needed. Use the time to explain what you know and learned. We will post your code after the presentation for your peers to review in more depth.

Rubric will be posted by 4/16.

Signup will be released  after class on Thursday, 4/19.
