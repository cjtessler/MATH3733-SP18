<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>Your overall course grade will be the weighted average of the following assessments:</p>
<ul><li>Programming assignments (40%)
</li><li>Reading Assignments (20%)
</li><li>Midterm (20%)
</li><li>Final Project (20%)
</li></ul>
<br>
<h3>Programming Assignments (40%)</h3>
<p>Problems will be assigned on a regular basis in order to develop mastery of the concepts developed in class. While searching the internet may provide quick solutions to many of the problems,  it is expected that you put the necessary effort into each programming exercise. You will have a much deeper understanding of the concepts by experimenting until you are successful.</p>
<br>
<h3>Reading Assignments (20%)</h3>
<p>There will be a reading assigned each Tuesday along with a set of questions. You may use the book, internet, and Python interpreter to answer the questions. You are also welcome to discuss the problems with your peers, but under no circumstance should you copy a peer’s work. If you are struggling to understand a concept, feel free to talk to me.</p>
<br>
<h3>Midterm (20%)</h3>
<p>There will be an in-class assessment covering the basics of the Python language.  More details for the exam will be given in class as the date of the exam approaches. The exam is tentatively scheduled for <b>Thursday March 22, 2018</b>.</p>
<br>
<h3>Final Project (20%)</h3>
<p>The final project is your opportunity to take your newfound savvy with programming out for a spin and develop your very own piece of software. So long as your project draws upon the course’s lessons, the nature of your project is entirely up to you, albeit subject to approval. Details for the final project will be given on Week 11.</p>
<br>

<h2>Exam Policy</h2>
<p><b>If a student misses an exam that is NOT an extreme, documented emergency the student will receive a zero for that exam.</b></p>
<br>
<p>A test may be made up only if the professor is contacted and provided with official, dated documentation of an EXTREME circumstance within 48 hours. Otherwise, the missed exam will be a zero in the grade book.</p>
<br>
<p>Examples of EXTREME circumstances are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>	Written proof of HOSPITAL/ER stay. No nurse’s notes, etc.
</li><li>	Written proof of subpoena/jury duty
</li><li>	Involved in an accident; must bring in police report
</li><li>	Death in immediate family (parent, grandparent, sibling); must bring in documentation
</li></ul>
<br>
<p>Examples of unacceptable excuses include (but not limited to the following):</p>
<ul><li>	Driving sick friend to doctor
</li><li>	Vacation
</li><li>	Weddings
</li><li>	Ministry Appointments
</li><li>	Visiting School Nurse
</li><li>	Job Interview
</li><li>	Headache, overslept, too tired, etc.
</li><li>	No ride to school
</li><li>	Rain
</li><li>	Not ready for exam
</li></ul>
<br>
<p>Students who miss an exam due to a school-sanctioned, Provost-approved event, including all athletic events, <b>MUST notify the instructor a minimum of one week in advance and MUST take the exam PRIOR to leaving on the school event unless notified in writing (handwritten or electronic) otherwise by the instructor.</b></p>
<br>
<h2>University Polices</h2>
<h3>Academic Integrity: </h3>
<p>Academic Integrity is assumed and expected of all students taking courses at Southeastern University. Plagiarism – the use of someone else’s words or ideas without giving that person credit – is dishonest and has serious consequences. The consequences of plagiarism are discussed in the SEU Student Handbook.</p>
<br>
<h3>Additional Assistance:</h3>
<p>Tutoring (Academic Center for Enrichment, Buena Vida)</p>
<p>Provides tutoring for developmental students and all students in need of tutoring.</p>
<p>Retention (Addison Building, Office #222)</p>
<p>Provides counseling for students planning to withdrawal. Helps withdrawing students find financial and other resources to be able to stay in school. Seeks to identify “at risk” students prior to withdrawal.</p>
<br>
<h3>Attendance Policy: </h3>
<p>Students are both expected and encouraged to attend classes regularly. The lack of attendance may affect a student’s grade. </p>
<p>For traditional fall and spring semesters, a student may miss a class without penalty equal to the number of times a class meets per week as follows: </p>
</li><li> If the class meets once a week a student may miss one class. </p>
</li><li> If the class meets two times a week a student may miss two classes. </p>
</li><li> If the class meets three times a week a student may miss three classes. </p>
<br>
<p>If a student’s absences exceed the number of times a class meets per week, a professor may: </p>
</li><li> Subject the student to a penalty of not more than one letter grade based on attendance alone. </p>
</li><li> Recommend to the Vice President for Academic Affairs that a student with excessive absences be withdrawn from the course. </p>
<br>
<p>Program directors must provide lists of students participating in authorized university activities or field trips to the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs.  Once approved, program directors must provide copies of the lists to the participating students for submission to the students’ instructors.  Faculty must take this information into account as they log attendance and not consider it an absence.</p>
<br>
<h3>Course Evaluation Statement:</h3>
<p>In order to help us to assess the effectiveness of our courses and instructors, if you receive a course evaluation for this course, you are required to complete it. </p>
<br>
<h3>Course Withdrawal: 	</h3>
<p>See the academic calendar to see when the last day to officially withdraw from this course is. A Course Withdrawal form (available in the Office of the Registrar or on the University website under Academics/Registrar/Forms) must be submitted no later than the withdrawal deadline.</p>
<br>
<h3>Disability Statement:</h3>
<p>Southeastern University is committed to the provision of reasonable accommodations for all students with learning and/or physical disabilities, as defined in Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and with the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990. This legislation guarantees educational rights for the physically and learning disabled.</p>
<p>Students with medical diagnoses which qualify them for accommodations must contact ADA Services at 863-667-5283 or email <a href="mailto:ADAservices@seu.edu">ADAservices@seu.edu</a>. Once medical documentation is provided and a confidential consultation is completed, the student will then be responsible to provide the Director of Academic & Auxiliary Services with a list of his or her current professors and their emails.</p>
<p>Contact with the Office of Academic & Auxiliary Services is mandatory for each new semester. For more information, visit the SEU Students with Disabilities page on our website.</p>
<br>
<h3>Final Exam Policy Statement:</h3>
<p>Final exam will be administered during finals’ week in the room where the class normally meets. Since the class meets during two time slots, the class will vote on which time slot to take the final as the date approaches.</p>
<br>
<p>Every professor is obligated to administer a final exam or hold an appropriate class during the regularly scheduled exam period. Every student is obligated to take the final exam or attend that appropriate class during the regularly scheduled exam period. Please plan accordingly and carefully for final exams.  </p>
<br>
<p>You must not plan vacations, ministry appointments, weddings, airline flights, or any other similar activity or engagement that will conflict with the final exam schedule.  Also, do not schedule any of these activities so close to your final exam that the commute to the activity conflicts with the final exam schedule.  </p>
<br>
<p>Final exams will be administered in the room where the class normally meets.  Students with more than 3 exams scheduled on one day can petition the instructor and department chair/college dean to take one of the exams another day. </p>
<br>
<h3>Grading Scale: </h3>
<p>The university’s general grading scale is provided in the Academic Policies and Procedures section of the Southeastern University Catalog.  All undergraduate courses use the following scale:</p>
<ul>
<li> A	=	94 – 100% </li>
<li> A-	=	90 –  93% </li>
<li> B+	=	87 –  89% </li>
<li> B	=	84 –  86% </li>
<li> B-	=	80 –  83% </li>
<li> C+	=	77 –  79% </li>
<li> C	=	74 –  76% </li>
<li> C-	=	70 –  73% </li>
<li> D+	=	67 –  69% </li>
<li> D	=	64 –  66% </li>
<li> D-	=	60 –  63% </li>
<li> F	=	00 –  59% </li>
</ul>
<h3>Official Communication Statement:</h3>
<p>Southeastern University requires all faculty, staff and students to use their Southeastern email address for official university communication.  Students are required to check Southeastern email daily, as they will be held accountable for all communications sent through this medium.</p>
<br>
<h3>SEU Title IX:</h3>
<p>Southeastern University is committed to creating an environment for every student to thrive academically spiritually and socially. An aspect of creating this culture is providing avenues for students to discuss and report any activity that may compromise this commitment.  </p>
<p>Under a federal law known as Title IX, "no person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance" (Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972).  </p>
<p>While students should feel comfortable approaching faculty with issues they may be struggling with or concerns they may be having, students should know that all faculty and staff are required to report certain information about Sexual Misconduct and certain crimes to University administration, in order to help keep the University community safe, and to connect students to all of the resources and reporting options that are available. </p>
<p>For example, if you inform faculty or staff (in private or during class discussions) of an incident of Sexual Misconduct, that individual will keep the information as private as possible, but is required to bring it to the attention of the institution’s Title IX Office. If a student would like to talk to the Title IX office directly, they can do so by e-mail at <a href="mailto:smpowell@seu.edu">smpowell@seu.edu</a>, by phone at 863-667-5236, or in person at Pansler U225. For more information about Title IX reporting options at Southeastern, please go to: <a href="http://www.seu.edu/titleix">http://www.seu.edu/titleix</a>.</p>
<p>If you are struggling with an issue that is traumatic, unusually stressful, or results in disruptive behavior, faculty and staff will likely inform the Care Team. If students would like to reach out directly to the Care Team for assistance, they can do so at the Campus Counseling Center (<a href="http://myseu.seu.edu/services/counseling-health-wellness-services/seu-care-team/">http://myseu.seu.edu/services/counseling-health-wellness-services/seu-care-team/</a>) located in Health Services in Smith Hall, by phone at 863-667-5205, or by e-mail at <a href="mailto:care@seu.edu">care@seu.edu</a>.  </p>
